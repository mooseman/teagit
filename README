Teagit - the toy pseudo-quasi-repo-version-tracking thingy that is 
almost (but not quite) entirely unlike Git....  

If Git were a drink, and a Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer attempted 
to make it, it would probably create something like this....   

This is meant as a toy and nothing else, but feel free to 
weld aircraft wings, warp drives or anything else onto it. 

Teagit is released to the public domain. 

"Share and enjoy"......  ;)
