*** I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT INTERCAL! *** 

Teagit - the answer to the ultimate question of Life, the Universe and 
wondering what to do when you're a bored aspie coder with some 
time on your hands....

If Git were a drink, and a Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer attempted 
to make it, it would probably create something like this....

This is meant as a toy and nothing else, but feel free to 
weld aircraft wings, warp drives or anything else onto it.  

Teagit is released to the public domain.  

Brought to you by the letter "M" (for "moose" ;)  ) and the number 42.
