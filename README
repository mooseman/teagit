*** I CAN'T BELIEVE IT'S NOT INTERCAL! *** 

Teagit - the answer to the ultimate question of Life, the Universe and a 
bored aspie coder with some time on his hands....

The toy pseudo-quasi-version-tracking-like app that is 
almost (but not quite) entirely unlike Git....  

If Git were a drink, and a Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer attempted 
to make it, it would probably create something like this....   

No simulated version-tracking is present in either the Python or 
the C++ versions yet, but it is planned to be added.  

This is meant as a toy and nothing else, but feel free to 
weld aircraft wings, warp drives or anything else onto it.  

Teagit is released to the public domain.  

Brought to you by the number 42.  

"Share and enjoy"......  ;)
