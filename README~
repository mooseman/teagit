Teagit - the answer to the ultimate question of Life, the Universe and a 
bored aspie coder with some time on his hands....

The toy pseudo-quasi-repo-version-tracking thingy that is 
almost (but not quite) entirely unlike Git....  

If Git were a drink, and a Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer attempted 
to make it, it would probably create something like this....   

This is meant as a toy and nothing else, but feel free to 
weld aircraft wings, warp drives or anything else onto it.  

Teagit is released to the public domain.  

If anyone thinks that the Python version of this does not supply enough torment, 
then fear not - a Ruby version is also being planned^H^H^H^H^H^H^H
procrastinated about.  As for Haskell, well ... "a man can dream, can't he?"  

Brought to you by the number 42.  

"Share and enjoy"......  ;)
